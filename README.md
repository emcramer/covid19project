# README

I started this project in mid-March to track the progress of COVID-19 in my county. Data from [usafacts.org](https://usafacts.org/) makes it possible to examine the rate of change in each jusrisdiction of the USA, and calculate my own metrics (e.g., the change ratio).

To download and run:

```
shiny::runGitHub('emcramer/covid19project')
